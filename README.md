# REQUIREMENTS
1) WaveGAN training requirements
The requirements are the same as in the original WaveGAN project.

2) Pre-processing, classifier training and analysis requirements
To generate the sound, train the classifier, and perform the analysis the requirements are contained in the file requirements txt.



# REPOSITORY ORGANIZATION
## data-preprocessing
This directory contains all the codes useful to pre-process the data and prepare different types of datasets. ReadME available inside.

## classifier-training
This directory contains the codes to train the classifier once the training dataset is ready. Moreover, it contains the references to the necessary tools that one needs to run the experiments.

## classifier-analysis
This directory contains all the codes to analyze the training and generated data: syllable features, classifier evaluation, utils needed to plot and perform the analysis. ReadME available inside.
